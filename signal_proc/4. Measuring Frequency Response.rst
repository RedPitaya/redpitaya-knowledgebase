Goals of this lab
=================
In this course, our primary objective in the lab is to delve deeply into the realm of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. We will embark on a comprehensive exploration, combining theoretical analysis, practical measurements, parameter estimation, and demonstrations to gain a thorough understanding of the frequency responses exhibited by these systems. Additionally, we will examine their application in evaluating real-world components, and elucidate the intriguing concept of LTI system stacking.To commence this educational journey, we will engage in meticulous analysis of simple LTI systems.

LTI systems
-----------

In general, a Linear system is a system that takes and input :math:`X`,
and produces an output :math:`Y`, that can be defined by a series of
linear operators. Recall a linear operator is an operation that
satisfies the principles of scalar multiplication and superposition.
More mathematically, for vectors :math:`\mathbf{x,y}`, scalars
:math:`\alpha,\beta`, the operator :math:`A` is linear if:

.. math:: A(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha A(x) + \beta A(y)


is satisfied. Examples of linear operators are:

- Differentiation/Integration

- Convolution

- Gradient/Divergence/Curl

- Laplace/Fourier transforms

Note that if there are multiple Linear systems, their cascaded effect
can be described by composing each subsequent system with the output of
the other. This is equivalent to combing each of the operators the
systems are implementing and forming a compound operator.

Time invariance is the property that for a given system, if :math:`y(t)`
is the output of the system when given an input :math:`x(t)`, then
applying a delayed input :math:`x(t - T)` will produce :math:`y(t - T)`,
a delayed version of :math:`y(t)`. In the Time domain, this system has
an impulse response :math:`h(t)` and relates :math:`y(t)`,\ :math:`x(t)`
by the relation:

.. math:: y(t) = h(t)*x(t)

Where :math:`*` is the convolution operation. The act of convolution can
be difficult, so it is oftentimes more convenient to operate in another
domain through some sort of transformation. A common transform is the
Fourier transform, whereby a time domain signal is represented in the
frequency domain. A consequence of the transform is the convolution
operation is now reduced to multiplication.

.. math:: y(t) = h(t)*x(t) \rightarrow Y(f) = H(f)X(f)

Where :math:`H(f)` is now the transfer function or frequency response of
the system. Canonically, the transfer function is written as:

.. math:: H(f) = \frac{Y(f)}{X(f)} = \frac{a_0 + a_1f + a_2f^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1}f^n}{b_0 + b_1f + b_2f^2 + \cdots + b_{m-1}f^m}; \quad n,m \in \mathbb{Z}^+


Every LTI system can be described by a given transfer function, with
various systems being formed by various coefficients :math:`a,b`. In
this lab, we will form a small number of systems with real components,
and examine their behaviors.

Transfer Function
-------------------------
The transfer function is a fundamental concept in the analysis and design of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. It represents the relationship between the input and output signals of a system in the frequency domain. By examining the transfer function, we can understand how the system processes different frequency components of the input signal. It captures the system's frequency response characteristics, such as amplification, attenuation, and phase shifts.

Mathematically as mentioned above, the transfer function, denoted as H(f), is defined as the ratio of the output signal Y(f) to the input signal X(f):

.. math:: H(f) = \frac{Y(f)}{X(f)}

The transfer function is obtained through the Fourier transform of the system's impulse response, simplifying the analysis of the system's behavior. It is typically expressed as a rational function of complex variables, with the numerator and denominator represented by polynomials. This allows us to determine the system's gain and phase response. Understanding the transfer function enables engineers and researchers to design LTI systems with desired frequency response characteristics, optimizing their performance for specific applications.
By leveraging the transfer function, we can accurately analyze and predict how a system amplifies or attenuates specific frequencies and introduces phase shifts. This knowledge is invaluable for tailoring the system's behavior to meet the desired requirements.


Types of Filters
--------------------
Filters are LTI systems used to modify the frequency content of a signal. They can be classified into different types based on their frequency response characteristics. A low-pass filter allows frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies. It is commonly used to remove high-frequency noise and retain the low-frequency components of a signal. A high-pass filter, on the other hand, allows frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies. It is useful for extracting high-frequency information and eliminating low-frequency noise. A band-pass filter allows a specific range of frequencies to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside that range. It finds applications in tasks such as signal isolation and frequency selection. Finally, a band-stop filter, also known as a notch filter, attenuates a specific range of frequencies while allowing other frequencies to pass through. It is effective in removing unwanted frequency components or interference.

Frequency Response
---------------------
The frequency response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system provides crucial insights into its behavior across different frequencies. It characterizes how the system processes and modifies signals of varying frequencies. The frequency response consists of two components: the magnitude response and the phase response.

The magnitude response represents the system's gain or attenuation for each frequency component. It quantifies how much the system amplifies or attenuates different frequencies in the input signal. Mathematically, the magnitude response is denoted as

.. math:: |H(f)|

where

.. math:: H(f)

is the transfer function of the system. By examining the magnitude response, we can understand how the system enhances or diminishes specific frequency components, thereby shaping the overall spectral content of the output signal.

The phase response, on the other hand, reveals the phase shift introduced by the system at each frequency. It indicates the time delay or advance experienced by different frequency components of the input signal. The phase response is denoted as

.. math:: \phi(f)

and is essential for applications where phase synchronization or time relationships between signals are critical. By analyzing the phase response, we can determine the phase characteristics of the system and how it influences the timing of the output signal relative to the input signal at different frequencies.

Both the magnitude and phase responses are typically plotted as functions of frequency to visualize their characteristics. These frequency response plots provide valuable information about the system's behavior, such as frequency selectivity, gain variations, and phase distortions. They serve as a powerful tool for analyzing and designing systems in various fields, including signal processing, communication, audio engineering, and control systems.


Impulse Response
------------------------
In the time domain, the impulse response of an LTI system is a key concept for understanding its behavior. It characterizes the system's response when the input signal is an impulse function, often represented as :math:h(t).
The impulse response provides valuable insights into how the system processes signals over time and shapes the output signal based on its inherent properties.
Mathematically, the output signal :math:y(t) of an LTI system can be obtained by convolving the input signal :math:x(t) with the impulse response :math:h(t) as expressed by the integral equation:

.. math:: y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau) d\tau

This equation represents the superposition of the weighted contributions of the input signal at different time instances, where the weights are determined by the impulse response. The impulse response reveals the system's temporal characteristics and provides information about its response to instantaneous changes in the input signal. By examining the impulse response, we can understand phenomena such as signal distortion, time-domain filtering, and transient behavior of the system.

Stability
------------------
Stability is a fundamental property of LTI systems that ensures their reliable and predictable operation. A stable system maintains a bounded output for bounded input signals, providing confidence in its performance and behavior. Stability analysis is crucial in evaluating the robustness and reliability of LTI systems.
The stability of an LTI system can be determined by examining its transfer function or impulse response. Various stability criteria, such as the location of poles in the complex plane or the boundedness of the impulse response, are employed to assess stability. A stable system exhibits desirable characteristics, such as controlled response to inputs, absence of oscillations, and suppression of noise and disturbances. In contrast, an unstable system may exhibit erratic behavior, uncontrollable oscillations, or even diverging responses.
Ensuring stability is of utmost importance in the design and analysis of LTI systems. It enables reliable signal processing, accurate control systems, and effective communication. 

By analyzing the stability of an LTI system, we can gain insights into its performance limitations and make informed decisions in system design and implementation. Stability considerations become particularly crucial in applications where precision, robustness, and error-free operation are essential.
Stable LTI systems have widespread applications in various fields, including control systems, telecommunications, audio processing, and image processing. They provide a foundation for designing systems that exhibit desired behaviors, such as accurate signal reproduction, noise suppression, and precise control of dynamic processes. Stability analysis allows engineers and researchers to ensure the reliability and safety of LTI systems in real-world scenarios, where external disturbances, noise, and uncertainties may be present.

Furthermore, stability analysis plays a pivotal role in stability-based control design. Controllers are designed to stabilize unstable systems or improve the stability margins of marginally stable systems. Stability analysis techniques help identify the critical parameters and system characteristics that affect stability, guiding the selection and adjustment of control parameters to achieve desired stability and performance objectives.

In summary, understanding and analyzing the stability of LTI systems is crucial for ensuring their reliable operation, robustness, and optimal performance. Stability considerations guide system design, control design, and decision-making processes in various engineering disciplines. By evaluating the stability characteristics of LTI systems, engineers and researchers can create systems that meet performance requirements, mitigate undesirable effects, and deliver reliable and predictable results in diverse applications.

columns (1,2,3,…,30). The exception to the rules are the bus bars on the
extreme sides of the breadboard, where the entire row of the (-,+) rows
are all electrically connected together. This is useful when using
common terminals that are used through the circuit (as in the case of

Analysis
^^^^^^^^

The claimed transfer function of this circuit is

.. math::
\begin{matrix}
T(f) = \ \frac{V_{out}(f)}{V_{in}(f)} = \frac{1}{1 + j2\pi fRC}\ #(1) \
\end{matrix}

Where :math:j = \sqrt{- 1} is the imaginary unit.

What is the magnitude of the transfer function?

*The magnitude of the transfer function can be calculated by taking the absolute value of :math:T(f):*

*The magnitude of the transfer function is given by :math:\left| T(f) \right| = \left| \frac{1}{1 + j2\pi fRC} \right|.*

What is the phase response of the circuit?

*The phase response of the circuit can be obtained by calculating the angle of :math:T(f):*

*The phase response of the circuit is given by :math:\phi(f) = \angle T(f).*

What class (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop) of filter is this? (This is equivalent to asking what happens to :math:\left| T(f) \right| as :math:f gets lower or higher?)

*To determine the class of the filter, we need to observe the behavior of :math:\left| T(f) \right| as the frequency :math:f changes. Based on the transfer function, we can conclude that this is a low-pass filter. As the frequency decreases, the magnitude of the transfer function increases, indicating that low frequencies are passed through while attenuating higher frequencies.*

At what frequency does :math:\left| T(f) \right| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707? (This corresponds to the so-called “half power point” where the ratio of the input to output power is 2 (-3dB) – The circuit drops half of the total power) This value is generally referred to the “cutoff frequency” or “-3dB frequency” and is represented by :math:f_c.
To find the cutoff frequency, we set the magnitude of the transfer function to :math:\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} and solve for :math:f:

*The cutoff frequency, :math:f_c, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function is equal to :math:\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707. It represents the frequency at which the filter starts attenuating the input signal.*

*(Optional) What would happen if I swapped the input and output ports? (Hint: is there any current flowing through the resistor?) Swapping the input and output ports would reverse the direction of signal flow. However, since there is no current flowing through the resistor in the given circuit, swapping the ports would not have any significant impact on the circuit's behavior.*

Respond to the following questions:

Use the expression you derived to calculate the value of :math:R from the measured value of :math:f_c.

The previous analysis all presumed we knew the value of :math:f,C perfectly. In reality, the values of there are only approximately known.

a. If the capacitance value :math:C can vary :math:\pm 20\%, what is the bounds on the error of the calculated value of :math:R?

b. If the frequency :math:f value can vary :math:\pm 0.1\%, what is the bounds on the error of the calculated value of :math:R?

c. If both :math:C,f as above simultaneously, what is the total bounding on the error of the calculated value of :math:R? (Hint: This should be a rectangular area)

(Optional) In the same line of thought, assume that the values of :math:C,f are described statistically by Gaussian distributions with mean and variances provided below:

To answer these questions, we can use the expression derived earlier to calculate the value of :math:R based on the measured value of :math:f_c. Then, we can analyze the impact of variations in capacitance and frequency on the calculated value of :math:R.

*a. If the capacitance value :math:C can vary :math:\pm 20\%, the error in the calculated value of :math:R will depend on how the capacitance variation affects the transfer function. This can be determined by re-calculating the transfer function using the maximum and minimum values of capacitance and then finding the corresponding values of :math:R that give the same transfer function. The difference between these maximum and minimum values of :math:R represents the bounds on the error.*

*b. If the frequency value :math:f can vary :math:\pm 0.1\%, a similar approach can be used to calculate the bounds on the error of :math:R. By considering the maximum and minimum values of frequency, the corresponding values of :math:R can be determined to achieve the same transfer function.*

*c. When both capacitance and frequency vary simultaneously, the total bounding on the error of :math:R can be represented as a rectangular area in the parameter space, defined by the maximum and minimum values of capacitance and frequency.*

*(Optional)*

*Considering that capacitance and frequency follow Gaussian distributions with mean and variances provided, the resulting probability distribution of :math:R can be obtained by performing statistical analysis on the joint distribution of capacitance and frequency. This analysis involves propagating the uncertainties through the transfer function equation to determine the distribution of :math:R based on the distributions of capacitance and frequency.*

Respond to the following questions:

Does the shape of the frequency response match your expectation from the analysis? Is there any point that stands out as odd?

Find the -3dB point in the circuit, and compare this value to the one you previously calculated.

This circuit can be viewed as two separate 1st order filters (see section 3.1) cascaded. What would the expected transfer function of such an arrangement look like? How different is this from the expression you would expect from two ideal LTI systems?

*The shape of the frequency response should match the expected behavior based on the analysis. The -3dB point can be identified from the plot and compared to the calculated value. The expected transfer function of cascading two 1st order filters is the product of their individual transfer functions. For this circuit, the expected transfer function is given by :math:T(f) = H_1(f)H_2(f) = \frac{1}{1 + j2\pi fR_1C_1} \times \frac{1}{1 + j2\pi fR_2C_2}. This expression is different from the transfer function of two ideal LTI systems, which would be the sum of their individual transfer functions.*

*The magnitude of the transfer function is given by :math:\left| T(f) \right| = \left| \frac{1}{1 + j2\pi f\left\lbrack R_{1}C_{1} + C_{2}\left( R_{1} + R_{2} \right) \right\rbrack - 4\pi^{2}f^{2}R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}} \right|.*

What is the phase response of the circuit?
*The phase response of the circuit can be obtained by calculating the angle of :math:T(f):*

*The phase response of the circuit is given by :math:\phi(f) = \angle T(f).*

What class (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop) of filter is this?
*To determine the class of the filter, we need to observe the behavior of :math:\left| T(f) \right| as the frequency :math:f changes. Based on the transfer function, we can conclude that this is a band-stop filter. It attenuates a specific range of frequencies while allowing other frequencies to pass through.*

What is the -3dB frequency?
*The -3dB frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function drops to :math:\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707. To find this frequency, we can set the magnitude of the transfer function to :math:\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} and solve for :math:f:*

*The -3dB frequency corresponds to the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function is :math:\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707.*

Measurement
^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the Red Pitaya’s Bode Analyzer tool, measure the frequency response (:math:\left| T(f) \right|) as described in section 3.1.2.

Show the plot of the measurement below:


(Optional) Try sweeping from 10Hz to 1MHz. Is there anything strange that happens to the frequency response? Capture the frequency response, and describe what seems to happen to the transfer function.


Comparison
^^^^^^^^^^

Respond to the following questions:

Does the shape of the frequency response match your expectation from the analysis? Is there any point that stands out as odd?

Find the -3dB point in the circuit, and compare this value to the one you previously calculated.
