Measuring Inductance
============================

Objective
===============
In this section, we will discuss the measurement of inductance, which is a fundamental property of electrical circuits. Inductance is a measure of an object's ability to store electrical energy in a magnetic field, and it is expressed in henries (H). Inductance measurement is essential in many areas of electrical engineering, including power transmission, signal processing, and electronic circuit design. Inductance measurement can be challenging due to various factors, including stray inductance, parasitic inductance, and measurement instrument limitations.


Inductors
================
Inductors are essential passive electronic components used in a variety of applications, such as power supplies, filters, and oscillators. They store energy in the form of a magnetic field when an electrical current flows through them and release that energy when the current changes. In this introduction to inductors, we will explore the basic principles, types, and applications of inductors in electronic circuits.

Basic Principles of Inductors
------------------------------
An inductor consists of a coil of wire, usually wound around a magnetic core. When an electric current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field around it. This magnetic field stores energy, and when the current changes, the energy is released back into the circuit. The inductor's ability to store and release energy is determined by its inductance, which is measured in henrys (H). The inductance value depends on factors such as the number of turns in the coil, the coil's dimensions, and the core material.

The inductance of an inductor is given by equation:



Thus, the estimated value of the unknown inductor is approximately 1.326 mH. Keep in mind that this is an approximation and may not be the exact value, but it should provide a reasonable estimate for your experiment. The specified inductor value was 1mH but note that is made with 15% tolerance, which means our measurement was really an approximation of the value.
